# Reactuate

Reactuate is an opinionated stack for building React-based frontend applications. Core objectives are as follows:

1. Fork-and-forget (or fork-and-follow) is not a great way to keep up with what's happening in the frontend space. Therefore, starting off from a cloned boilerplate "kit" is not an acceptable solution. Reactuateis distributed as a __dependency__.
1. Reactuate is strictly a frontend-oriented stack and is not meant to provide a foundation for so called "universal" (server and client side) JavaScript applications.
1. Reducing the amount of noise. Many kits suffer from the need to create too many files for each "functional vertical" (such as
   action creators, constants, reducer), which in turn leads to increased maintenance complexity (try renaming one of the vericals),
   "import nightmare" and inability to have a compact overview of the functionality.
1. Discovering and learning the capabilities of comprehensive stack solution could be complicated. What's even worse, maintaining such stacks can be equally painful. Therefore, unconventionally, Reactuate is written as a *literate program* and is meant to be read as a small book and be a concise reference manual â€” while being a functional library.
1. Don't cling on the legacy stuff. Move forward.

## Version

Current published version:

    0.1.0

## License

Reactuate is licensed under the terms of [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.md).

# Requirements

Reactuate requires the minimum of the following version of Node.js:

[Node.js version]()

    v5.4.1

More recent versions are allowed, within the upper boundary of the next major version.

In order to produce the extracted source code of Reactuate (should you need it), you will need `litpro` npm package to be installed. Currently required version:

[litpro version]()

    0.8.4

Building Reactute is quite simple:

```shell
$ litpro -b . README.md
```

# Getting started

As it has been mentioned before, Reactuate is distributed as a dependency, and can, therefore, be installed with npm (assuming you already initialized your project with `npm init`):

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev reactuate
```

The rest of this manual will introduce you to concepts and software used in the stack.


# Webpack Layer

We serve the application in development mode and package the production version by employing [webpack](http://webpack.github.io). Current required version:

[webpack version]()

    1.12.11

[Dependencies](#:Dependencies ":|dependencies")
```
webpack/Webpack Layer
webpack-dev-server/Running a development Webpack Server
html-webpack-plugin/Webpack Configuration
babel-loader/Webpack Configuration
json-loader/Webpack Configuration
```

## Webpack Configuration

There's normally little to no Webpack configuration tweaking you need to do.

By default, it will assume your index.html to be this:

[index.html]()
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
		<title>Reactuate-based application</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="app"></div>
	</body>
</html>
```

[index.html](#:index.html "save:")

When you are ready to override it, simply copy the above file to the root of your project:

[index file]()
```js
require('fs').existsSync(path.join(process.cwd(), 'index.html')) ?
  path.join(process.cwd(), 'index.html') : path.join(__dirname, 'index.html')
```
This file will be processed with `html-webpack-plugin`, version:

[html-webpack-plugin version]()

    1.7.0


Reactuate will search for your source code files in this directory in your project:

[source directory]()

    src

It will assume your main file in that directory to be

[main file]()

    index.js

All the JavaScript files are going to be process by Babel through the use of
`babel-loader` plugin, current version:

[babel-loader version]()

    6.2.1

To enable ES2015 syntax and experimental features, the following plugins are required:

[babel-preset-es2015 version]()

    6.3.13

[babel-preset-stage-0 version]()

    6.3.13

To enable React-specific features, a number of Babel plugins is required:

[babel-plugin-react-transform version]()

    2.0.0

[babel-preset-react version]()

    6.3.13

[babel-preset-react-hmre version]()

    1.0.1

In production builds, following optimizations are used:

[babel-plugin-transform-react-constant-elements version]()

    6.4.0

[babel-plugin-transform-react-inline-elements version]()

    6.4.0

[babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types version]()

    0.1.0

Source code builds will produced into this directory in your project:

[build directory]()

    build

Other required loaders:

[json-loader version]()

    0.5.4

[]()

This is how the configuration is composed:

[webpack-config.js](# "save:")
```js
var path = require('path')

var webpack = require('webpack')
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = function(options) {
  var plugins = []
  var loaders = []

  var production = process.env['NODE_ENV'] === 'production'
  var src = '_":source directory"'
  var main = '_":main file"'
  var index = _":index file"
  console.log('Using ' + index + ' as an index file')

  var entry = path.resolve(process.cwd(), path.join(src, main))
```

When in development mode, webpack should use Webpack development server:

```js
  if (!production) {
    entry = [
        "webpack-dev-server/client?http://localhost:3000", // Needed for hot reloading
        "webpack/hot/only-dev-server", // See above
        entry
      ]
  }
```

and enable hot module replacement

```js
  if (!production) {
    plugins.push(new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin())
    plugins.push(new HtmlWebpackPlugin({template: path.resolve(process.cwd(), index), inject: true}))
  }
```

```js
var jsLoaders = []
```
Reactuate enables ES2015, react/react hot module replacement, and stage-0 presets:

```js
  var react = require.resolve('babel-preset-react')
  var es2015 = require.resolve('babel-preset-es2015')
  var stage0 = require.resolve('babel-preset-stage-0')
  var react_hmre = require.resolve('babel-preset-react-hmre')
  jsLoaders.push('babel-loader?{presets:["' + react + '","' + es2015 + '","' + stage0 + '"],env: {development: {presets: ["' + react_hmre + '"]}, production: {plugins: ["transform-react-remove-prop-types","transform-react-constant-elements","transform-react-inline-elements"]}}}')
```

```js
  loaders.push({test: /\.js$/,
    loaders: jsLoaders,
    exclude: /node_modules/
  })
```

Reactuate also allows importing JSON files with [json-loader](https://github.com/webpack/json-loader) loader.

```js
  loaders.push({ test: /\.json$/, loader: 'json'})
```

```js
  return {
    entry: entry,
    plugins: plugins,
    output: {
      path: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '_":build directory"'),
      publicPath: '/',
      filename: 'js/bundle.js'
    },
    module: {loaders: loaders},
    target: "web", // Make web variables accessible to webpack, e.g. window
    stats: false, // Don't show stats in the console
    progress: true,
```

An important part is being able to resolve reactuate's own dependencies

```js
    resolve: {
      root: [path.resolve(path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules')), path.resolve(path.join(process.cwd(), 'node_modules'))]
    },
    resolveLoader: {
      root: [path.resolve(path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules')), path.resolve(path.join(process.cwd(), 'node_modules'))]
    }
  }
}
```


## Running a development Webpack server

It is imperative to be able to run an easy to update, hot-reloadable development version of the application before shipping an optimized version of it. This is what `webpack-dev-server` does. Reactuate currently requires the following version:

[webpack-dev-server version]()

    1.14.1

In order to start a development Webpack server, you can run:

[]()
```shell
$ node node_modules/reactuate/webpack-dev-server.js
```

Alternatively, you can add a convenience helper to your `package.json`:

[]()
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node node_modules/reactuate/webpack-dev-server.js"
}
```

With this you can simply run the following to start your development server:

```shell
$ npm start
```

### Development server

[webpack-dev-server.js](# "save:")
```js
var path = require('path'),
    webpack = require('webpack'),
    WebpackDevServer = require('webpack-dev-server'),
    config = require(path.join(__dirname, 'webpack-config'))()

console.log('Starting server...\n')

new WebpackDevServer(webpack(config), { // Start a server
  publicPath: config.output.publicPath,
  hot: true, // With hot reloading
  inline: false,
  historyApiFallback: true,
  quiet: false
}).listen(3000, 'localhost', function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    console.log('Server started')
    console.log('Listening at localhost:3000')
  }
})
```

# Language Layer

## Babel Layer

Reactuate encourages the use of recent versions of Babel. [Babel](http://babeljs.io) is a transpiler from future versions of ECMAScript to JavaScript you can run in the browser today.

Reactuate currently depends on the following version of Babel:

[babel-core version]()

    6.4.0

Babel 6 is still fairly new and unfortunately, not all tools support it well, but this should be less of a problem going forward.

In order to avoid generating plain JavaScript files for this package, we alsoinclude [babel-register](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/require/)

[babel-register version]()

    6.4.3

[Dependencies](#:Dependencies ":|dependencies")
```
babel-core/Babel Layer
babel-register/Babel Layer
babel-plugin-react-transform/Webpack Configuration
babel-plugin-transform-react-constant-elements/Webpack Configuration
babel-plugin-transform-react-inline-elements/Webpack Configuration
babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types/Webpack Configuration
babel-preset-es2015/Webpack Configuration
babel-preset-react/Webpack Configuration
babel-preset-react-hmre/Webpack Configuration
babel-preset-stage-0/Webpack Configuration
```

# React Layer

Reactuate currently depends on the following version of React:

[react version]()

    0.14.6

[react-dom version]()

    0.14.6

[Dependencies](#:Dependencies ":|dependencies")

    react/React Layer
    react-dom/React Layer

## Redux Layer

Part of React's power lies in the so called "Flux" architecture. There are many
different implementations of it, and Reactuate is using [Redux](http://rackt.org/redux/)

[redux version]()

    3.0.5

[react-redux version]()

    4.0.6

[Dependencies](#:Dependencies ":|dependencies")

    redux/Redux Layer
    react-redux/Redux Layer

## React Routing

As a foundation for routing React applications, we use [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)

[react-router version]()

    2.0.0-rc5

We also supplement it with a [Redux extension](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-router). Although this
one is less stable, we believe it has more comprehensive functionality comparing to [redux-simple-router](redux-simple-router).

[redux-router version]()

    1.0.0-beta7

We encapsulate `ReduxRouter` into our own Router to hide some of the complexity.

[Router.js]()
```js
import React from 'react'
import { ReduxRouter } from 'redux-router'

class Router extends React.Component {

  static propTypes = {
     children: React.PropTypes.node
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <ReduxRouter>
        {this.props.children}
      </ReduxRouter>
    )
  }
}
```

However, since there is more than one thing that requires your routes, we
export a function that takes your routes, and produces a `Router` component
as well as a [store enhancer](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/Glossary.html#store-enhancer):

```js
import { createHistory } from 'history'
import { reduxReactRouter, routerStateReducer } from 'redux-router'

export default function(routes) {
  return {
    Router: React.createClass({

      render() {
        return <Router>{routes}</Router>
      }

    }),
    storeEnhancer: reduxReactRouter({routes, createHistory})
  }
}
```

# Appendix 0. Package Dependencies

To simplify dependency definition, the following `dependencies` definition should be used:

[dependencies](# "define: async")
```js
function(input, args, cb) {
  var dependencies = []
  var lines = input.split(/\n/).filter(function (line) {
    return !line.trim().startsWith("#")
  })
  lines.forEach(function(line) {
    var vals = line.split("/"),
      dependency = vals[0],
      href = vals[1] || ""
    doc.retrieve(doc.getBlock(href + ':' + dependency + ' version'), function(v) {
      dependencies.push('"' + dependency + '": "' + v + '"')
      if (dependencies.length === lines.length) {
        cb(null, dependencies.join(',\n'))
      }
    })
  })
}
```
