# Important Notice

Reactuate is an example of literate programming. If you are considering making a contribution, please apply it against README.md (where the actual program is), not generated effects (pretty much all other files). Doing so will speed up merging your contribution greatly.

To propagate changes made `README.md` to the rest of the project, either `npm install -g doctoc litpro` and `make`, or use `npm run make` to run the `npm install`ed versions.
